# Error

If you got a window with an error, then most likely the error is from Chromium.

We define some common errors where it will show the error and ways to solve it.

If the error is unknown, check the error in the [Chromium docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/base/net\_error\_list.h).

Or [contact us](../overview/feedback.md) for possible solutions.
