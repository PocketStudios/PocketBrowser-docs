Do you have a Smart TV that supports Chromecast?

You can use the cast feature to send links or videos to your TV.

* Open a YouTube link in Pocket Browser.
* Make sure your TV/Chromecast is turned on.
* Click on the Menu button then `Cast`.
* It will show a window with `Choose device`
* Click on your device and click `Cast`.

You can then have control of the cast. You can change the volume or pause/stop the video.

#### Didn't find your device?

In this case make sure your device is turned on. And try casting from a different device.

If the device is working, try restart the browser. Otherwise [contact us](../overview/feedback.md) for support.
