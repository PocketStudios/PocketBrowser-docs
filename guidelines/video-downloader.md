# Video Downloader

{% hint style="warning" %}
**YouTube** downloads are currently unavailable as it's against YouTube's ToS.
{% endhint %}

The browser currently has a built-in video downloader.

It can't detect all videos. To download a compatible video, go to the page and start playing the video. If it's detected it will show a window asking to download. Otherwise it's not supported.

Please provide help with this feature by providing video downloads that dont work to us so we can fix it in [Feedback](../overview/feedback.md).
