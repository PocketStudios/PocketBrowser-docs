# Google Account

Unfortunately, **Google** is currently preventing users of the browser to Login to Google Accounts assuming they're insecure as they only allow logins from popular browsers (_Chrome, Edge, Firefox,..)_ regardless if they're secure or not.

Google can't detect if the browser is secure or not. We're trying to solve this problem with Google and allow logins from the browser in the future.
