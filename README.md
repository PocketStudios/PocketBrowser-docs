## Overview

****<img src=".gitbook/assets/icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">**Pocket Browser** is an open source browser built under the **Chromium** engine.

The main focus and the vision is to build the browser that provides you with enough privacy by blocking all trackers and asking for permissions that other browsers give automatically. While providing a powerful browser with all the essentials. _It's the second generation browser._
